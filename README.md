# terrance-mckenna
## Terrance Mckenna is all about open-source, there's nothing more open source than a git repository.
### I think Terrance McKenna would prefer to have lived on as a repository that anyone could download/change/fork(lol)/comment. This is what git allows you to do.
#### What do you think? Change this readme file or leave a comment.
